# Tape Punch Controller Laser Cutter Designs

These files are in DXF format, readable by [librecad][librecad]. Some designs also have older versions created in 
[FreeCAD][freecad], which I stopped using since it crashed too much.

Part designs in this directory are:

* `back-panel`: a cover for the cavity in the rear of the tape punch's case through which the power and data cables are 
wired. This is to reduce the risk of injury resulting from exposed live wiring.
* `psu-cover`: a minimal cover for the exposed live terminals on the [28V power supply unit][psu]. This is only for 
development; suitable protection will be built into the final product's case design.
